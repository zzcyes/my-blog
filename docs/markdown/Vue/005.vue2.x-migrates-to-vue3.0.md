# 005.vue2.x-migrates-to-vue3.0

## Notable New Features

### [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html#why-composition-api)

### [Teleport](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/teleport.html)

### [Fragments](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/fragments.html)

- vue2.x

```html
<!-- Layout.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <header>...</header>
    <main>...</main>
    <footer>...</footer>
  </div>
</template>
```

- vue3.0

In 3.x, components now can have multiple root nodes! However, this does require developers to explicitly define where attributes should be distributed.

```html
<template>
  <header>...</header>
  <main v-bind="$attrs">...</main>
  <footer>...</footer>
</template>
```

### [createRenderer API 从 @vue/runtime-core 创建自定义渲染器](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/tree/master/packages/runtime-core)

@vue/runtime-core

> This package is published only for typing and building custom renderers. It is NOT meant to be used in applications.

For full exposed APIs, see `src/index.ts`. You can also run `yarn build runtime-core --types` from repo root, which will generate an API report at `temp/runtime-core.api.md`.

Building a Custom Renderer

```javascript
import { createRenderer } from '@vue/runtime-core';

const { render, createApp } = createRenderer({
  patchProp,
  insert,
  remove,
  createElement,
  // ...
});

// `render` is the low-level API
// `createApp` returns an app instance with configurable context shared
// by the entire app tree.
export { render, createApp };

export * from '@vue/runtime-core';
```

See `@vue/runtime-dom` for how a DOM-targeting renderer is implemented.

### [单文件组件 `<style scoped>` 现在可以包含全局规则或只针对插槽内容的规则](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0023-scoped-styles-changes.md)

- `>>>` and `/deep/` support are deprecated.

- ::v-deep usage as a combinator is deprecated:

```
/_ DEPRECATED _/
::v-deep .bar {}
```

Instead, use it as a pseudo element that accepts another selector as argument:

```
::v-deep(.bar) {}
```

The above compiles to:

```
[v-data-xxxxxxx] .bar {}
```

- Slot content passed in from the parent no longer gets affected by child scoped styles by default. Instead, the child now needs to use the new ::v-slotted() pseudo element to specifically target slot content:

```
::v-slotted(.foo) {}
```

Compiles to:

```
.foo[v-data-xxxxxxx-s] {}
```

Notice the -s postfix which makes it target slot content only.

- New pseudo element ::v-global() can be used to apply global rules inside a <style scoped> block:

```
::v-global(.foo) {}
```

Compiles to:

```
.foo {}
```

The test cases of `@vue/compiler-sfc` can be used as a reference for the compilation transform details.
